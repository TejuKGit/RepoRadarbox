            What is it?
RadarBox’s Airport View has been designed around the needs and requirements of aircraft owners, FBO’s, charter companies and other aviation-related businesses such as airports that are involved with airport traffic operations. Airport View primarily displays incoming and outgoing flight traffic of a single airport. In addition, other features like live weather, and separate arrival and departure cards make it one of the most versatile amongst all of the existing tools currently out there on the market.

The customizability options with Airport View are unmatched. Users can choose up to 6 different maps and overlay them with numerous layers such as the weather layer, ATC boundaries layer and a day/night layer. Airport View can also serve as an information system to display flight arrival and departure information in airport lounges and waiting areas while passengers wait for their flights.
